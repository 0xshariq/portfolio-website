# üöÄ Package Installer CLI: Modern Web App Scaffolding Made Easy

## Introduction

Modern web development is fast-paced, but setting up a new project can still be tedious and error-prone. Developers often spend hours configuring frameworks, languages, UI libraries, databases, and ORMs before writing a single line of business logic. **Package Installer CLI** solves this by providing a beautiful, interactive, and highly flexible CLI that scaffolds production-ready projects in minutes.

## Motivation

Why another CLI? Most existing tools are either framework-specific or lack flexibility for full-stack, multi-language, or database-driven setups. Package Installer CLI is designed for:

- **Polyglot teams**: Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, and more
- **Full-stack development**: Easily combine frontend and backend templates
- **Rapid prototyping**: Get started with best practices and modern tooling
- **Customization**: Choose exactly what you need‚ÄîUI libraries, bundlers, src structure, Tailwind CSS, database, ORM, etc.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive CLI** with beautiful UI and strict prompt order
- **Argument-based project name** (supports `pi my-app` or `pi .` for current directory)
- **Framework, language, and UI library selection**
- **Dynamic database & ORM selection** (ORMs shown are specific to the selected database)
- **Automatic dependency installation** (`pnpm` or `npm`)
- **Cross-platform path handling**
- **Graceful exit and error messaging**
- **Combination templates** for full-stack setups
- **Extensible via `template.json`**

## üÜï What's New: Database-Specific ORM Selection

The latest release introduces **database-specific ORM selection**. When you choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), the CLI only shows ORMs compatible with that database, as defined in `template.json`. This prevents mismatches and streamlines setup.

<Highlight>
{`
if (database && fwConfig.databases[database] && Array.isArray(fwConfig.databases[database].orms)) {
  const dbOrms = fwConfig.databases[database].orms;
  if (dbOrms.length > 0) {
    // Prompt for ORM selection
  }
}
`}
</Highlight>

## Installation

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g package-installer-cli
```

## CLI Walkthrough

### 1. Start the CLI

```bash
pi my-app
# or
package-installer my-app
```

### 2. Interactive Prompts

You'll be guided through a series of questions:

- **Project name**: Use argument or prompt
- **Framework**: React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Express, Rust, etc.
- **Language**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust
- **UI library**: Shadcn, Material UI, etc. (if available)
- **Bundler**: Vite, Webpack, etc. (framework-specific)
- **Src directory**: Choose if you want a `src/` structure
- **Tailwind CSS**: Add Tailwind for modern styling
- **Database**: Select from supported databases
- **ORM**: Only ORMs compatible with your database are shown

### 3. Project Creation & Dependency Installation

The CLI copies the selected template, installs dependencies (`pnpm` or `npm`), and provides next steps.

### 4. Success Message & Next Steps

You'll see a styled summary with commands to start development, build, and more.

## Advanced Features

- **Combination Templates**: Scaffold full-stack projects with pre-configured frontend and backend
- **Rust Support**: Build modern Rust apps with basic or advanced templates
- **Graceful Exit**: Beautiful goodbye and error messages
- **Auto-detection**: Installs dependencies using the best available package manager

## Template Configuration: `template.json`

The CLI is powered by a flexible `template.json` file. Here‚Äôs a simplified example:

```json
{
  "frameworks": {
    "nextjs": {
      "languages": ["typescript", "javascript"],
      "ui": ["shadcn", "material-ui"],
      "databases": {
        "postgresql": { "orms": ["prisma", "typeorm"] },
        "mongodb": { "orms": ["mongoose"] },
        "none": { "orms": [] }
      },
      "options": ["src", "tailwind"],
      "bundlers": ["vite", "webpack"]
    }
    // ... other frameworks ...
  }
}
```

You can easily add new frameworks, languages, databases, or ORMs by editing this file.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Startup MVP**: Quickly scaffold a Next.js + PostgreSQL + Prisma app
- **Enterprise**: Standardize project structure for teams
- **Hackathons**: Save time on setup, focus on building
- **Learning**: Explore different stacks and configurations

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If a template is missing, check the `templates/` directory and `template.json`
- Use `pi .` to scaffold in the current directory
- For Rust projects, ensure you have `cargo` installed
- For full-stack templates, run frontend and backend in separate terminals
- Check the generated `README.md` for framework-specific instructions

## Roadmap & Future Plans

- **More frameworks**: Svelte, SolidJS, Python/Django, etc.
- **Custom template creation**: User-defined templates
- **Plugin system**: Extend CLI with custom logic
- **Cloud integration**: Deploy directly from CLI

## Example Workflow

```bash
$ pi my-app
üöÄ Choose a framework: Next.js
üíª Choose a language: TypeScript
üß© Do you want to add a UI library? Yes
‚ú® Choose a UI library: Shadcn
üì¶ Choose a bundler: Vite  ( only for reactjs and reactjs combination templates )
üìÇ Do you want a src directory? Yes
üé® Do you want to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
üóÑÔ∏è Choose a database: PostgreSQL
üîß Choose an ORM: Prisma
```

## Conclusion

Package Installer CLI is the fastest way to start modern web projects with best practices, flexibility, and beautiful developer experience. Whether you‚Äôre building a startup MVP, a full-stack enterprise app, or just learning, this CLI will save you time and help you focus on what matters‚Äîbuilding great software.
